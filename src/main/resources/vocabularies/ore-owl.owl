        <comment xml:lang="en">This is an OWL-ified version of the OAI-ORE 1.0 ontology. It was downloaded as application/rdf+xml from http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/ on 2011-11-17, converted with cwm 1.197 to N3, then edited with vim and Protege to:
  Make all properties Object Properties instead of rdf:Properties (avoids them becoming Annotation Properties in OWL)
  All classes are owl:Class instead of just rdfs:Class
  These properties are made functional: ore:describes, ore:proxyFor, ore:proxyIn
  Only one of the owl:inverseOf directions stated for ore:aggregates--ore:isAggregatedBy and ore:describes--ore:isDescribedBy

    <owl:Class rdf:about="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/Proxy">
        <comment>A Proxy represents an Aggregated Resource as it exists in a specific Aggregation. All assertions made about an entity are globally true, not only within the context of the Aggregation. As such, in order to make assertions which are only true of a resource as it exists in an Aggregation, a Proxy object is required. For example, one might want to cite an article as it appears in a specific journal, or assign aggregation-specific metadata to a Resource.</comment>

        <comment>Aggregations, by definition, aggregate resources. The ore:aggregates relationship expresses that the object resource is a member of the set of Aggregated Resources of the subject (the Aggregation). This relationship between the Aggregation and its Aggregated Resources is thus more specific than a simple part/whole relationship, as expressed by dcterms:hasPart for example.</comment>

        <comment>Proxy objects are used to represent a Resource as it is aggregated in a particular Aggregation. The ore:proxyFor relationship is used to link the proxy to the Aggregated Resource it is a proxy for. The subject of the relationship is a Proxy object, and the object of the relationship is the Aggregated Resource.</comment>

        <comment>The subject of this relationship MUST be an Aggregation.  This Aggregation should be considered an expression within the ORE context of the object of the relationship, as it is broadly equivalent to the resource. For example, the Aggregation may consist of the resources which, together, make up a journal article which has a DOI assigned to it. The Aggregation is not the article to which the DOI was assigned, but is a representation of it in some manner.</comment>
